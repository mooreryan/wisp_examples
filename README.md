# Wisp Examples

Some examples of using [Wisp](https://github.com/gleam-wisp/wisp), a web-framework for the [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) programming language.

The `justfile` has some helpful dev scripts if you want to take a look. Some of them use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) to rerun stuff when appropriate. (For more info about that, see [Using watchexec with Wisp](https://fieldnotes.tenderisthebyte.com/gleam/watchexec_wisp_eaddrinuse/).)

## Examples

- [`hello_world`](https://github.com/mooreryan/wisp_examples/tree/main/hello_world): Hello, World!
- [`tailwind`](https://github.com/mooreryan/wisp_examples/tree/main/tailwind): Using tailwindcss, daisyUI, & serving static assets
- [`client_side_form_validation`](https://github.com/mooreryan/wisp_examples/tree/main/client_side_form_validation): Using browser's built-in form validation with tailwind and daisyUI styling.
